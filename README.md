# landingpage-test

First attempt at a comprehensive landing page using learned skills from Odin Project. This was a great test to combine my basic html and css skills thus far. I am super comfortable at this point with using git to commit my changes to each project and navigate my different repos which is cool to see.

I am experiencing some sizing issues when I shrink my browser window. I tried implementing some font-size: "arbitrary" vw; properties but still having problems. Hopefully I get some exercises later on in the course which help me with working on sizing so my files are easily viewables on different platforms.
